Exercise 1: Write an informative README.md file
You can now write the README.md file for your repository. To make headings and
subheadings, put hashtags before a line of text - the more hashtags, the smaller the
heading will appear. You can make lists using - and numbers 1, 2, 3, etc.. When
working on a shared project, discuss what you may want to include with your
collaborators - here are some things you might want to consider:
- Your name
- Project title
- Links to website & social media
- Contact details
Once you have written your README.md file, scroll to the bottom of the page. You can
now commit the file to the repository. To do so, specify a commit message which
briefly describes the changes. Commit messages should concise, but
descriptive. Select Commit directly to the main branch and then click on Commit
changes.
